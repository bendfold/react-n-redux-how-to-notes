# React & Redux How To Notes

This project is just a way for me to keep notes on how React and Redux can be put together to work in a web app. I took almost all over the information from the excellent egghead.io courses [Getting started with redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) and [Building react applications with idiomatic redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux).
